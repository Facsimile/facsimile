# Use container-based architecture, which is faster and supports IVY & SBT file caching.

sudo: false

# Specify project language and supported versions.
#
# These values should be synchronized with the values in the custom SBT build definition file,
# project/FacsimileBuild.scala

language: scala
scala:
  - 2.12.0

# Cache the IVY & SBT directories at the end of the build.

cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.ivy2/cache
    - $HOME/.sbt/boot

# Before installing the necessary software, set up XVFB (X Windows virtual frame buffer) so that we can run
# JavaFX/ScalaFX code in headless mode.

before_install:
  - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
  - "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"

# We need Java 8 to build facsimile.
#
# Note: This is currently the only version of Java supported. If other versions become compatible, they will be included
# here.

jdk:
  - oraclejdk8

# Require the latest version of this JDK (since JavaFX, in particular, is sensitive to different builds - some features
# in the current version of ScalaFX require the latest release).

addons:
  apt:
    packages:
      - oracle-java8-installer

# Now perform the build.
#
# This firstly prints the java version used. Next, it executes SBT to perform scalastyle checking, coverage analysis and
# then execute the test suite. Subsequent to that, since Facsimile is a multi-module project, we must generate a report
# aggregated for all modules. The notify Coveralls of the test coverage results. (Note that both of these latter tasks
# must be performed as separate SBT commands.)

script:
  - sbt ++$TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION clean scalastyle coverage test doc &&
    sbt ++$TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION coverageAggregate

# If this script was successful, run the coveralls SBT task.

after_success:
  - sbt ++$TRAVIS_SCALA_VERSION coveralls

# For now, we'll only test the master branch.

branches:
  only:
    - master

# Notifications.
#
# By default, Travis will only send build notifications to the committer of the changes made, and to the project owner
# (if different). If you have forked Facsimile, and you are using Travis to verify your commits, then you are the owner
# (regardless of who is committing changes).
#
# As a committer, you will only get notifications if you have configured git with your email address. Furthermore, you
# will only receive notifications if you have write access to the associated repository.
