<summary>Generic state change event handler delegate.</summary>

<remarks>Delegated function for handling state change events raised by a <see
cref="StateContext {FinalContext, BaseState}" /> instance.

<para>The state change event is raised and processed after the change to the
new state has completed.  If virtual functions are called when the state has
been changed, the state change event will be raised once they have
completed also.</para></remarks>

<param name="sender">The <typeparamref name="FinalContext" />-derived instance
that raised the state change event.  The context instance's new state can be
obtained via its <see cref="StateContext {FinalContext,
BaseState}.CurrentState" /> property.</param>

<param name="priorState">The <typeparamref name="BaseState" />-derived instance
representing the <paramref name="sender" />'s previous state.</param>

<example>For an example of using this delegate, refer to <see
cref="StateContext {FinalContext, BaseState}" />.</example>

<typeparam name="FinalContext">The <see cref="StateContext {FinalContext,
BaseState}" />-derived type that represents the associated actual state
context class (or the polymorphic base class of the actual state context
class).</typeparam>

<typeparam name="BaseState">The <see cref="State {FinalContext, BaseState}"
/>-derived base class defining the set of available states for the associated
<typeparamref name="FinalContext"> type; all classes derived from this base

/**
<summary>Generic abstract base class for state context objects.</summary>

<remarks>A state context object is one that, at a given point in time, may be
in just one of an available set of states.  Furthermore, the behaviour of each
state context object depends upon its current state to the extent that it may
delegate some of its implementation to that state.

<para>Each state is represented by a class that is derived from <typeparamref
name="BaseState" />.  The set of available states are, therefore, the classes
that are derived from <typeparamref name="BaseState" />.  In this way, the set
of available states may be expanded with a minimum of effort.</para>

<para>This class should be employed as a base class by classes that implement
the State design pattern "Context" role.  Refer to Gamma, et al: "Design
Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software", Addison-Wesley, for
further information.</para></remarks>

<example>The following C# example demonstrates a "switch" (state context) that
has two states: "on" and "off".

<para>The switch is here represented by the <c>Switch</c> class, which is
derived from the <see cref="StateContext {FinalContext, BaseState}" /> class.
<c>SwitchState</c>, which is derived from the <see cref="State {FinalContext,
BaseState}" /> class, is the base class for the <c>OnState</c> and
<c>OffState</c> classes that represent the "on" and "off" states respectively;
these state classes are used to report whether the switch is on or off.</para>

TODO: Come back to this and tidy up at a later date.
