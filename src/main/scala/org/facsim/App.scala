Application object.

Provide information and functionality for applications built with the
''Facsimile'' library.

In order to function, client applications '''must''' apply an application
[[org.facsim.Behavior!]] via the [[org.facsim.App$.apply(Behavior)*]] function.

The application may utilize a graphical user interface, or be driven from the
command line, or both, depending upon the registered behavior.

Do not add functionality here!

To assist with testing, all functionality must be inherited from the
AppImplementation class instead.
