/**
Require that argument value is non-`null`.

Throw a [[java.lang.NullPointerException]] if supplied argument value is
`null`.

Normally, a `NullPointerException` will be thrown by the ''Java'' virtual
machine (''JVM'') if an attempt is made to de-reference a `null` pointer.
However, if a function takes an object reference argument and that argument is
not de-referenced until after the function has returned, then the function must
verify that the reference is non-`null` as one of its preconditions; this
function makes such precondition verification simpler.

Furthermore, even if the ''JVM'' can be relied upon to throw this exception,
performing this verification explicitly is regarded as good practice.  One
reason is that exceptions thrown by the ''JVM'' provide limited explanation to
the user as to their cause; this function provides an explanation
automatically.

@note All exceptions originating in ''Facsimile'' library code must provide a
detailed, locale-specific explanation to the user.

@todo It would be nice, once Scala 2.10 is available, if this could be
converted into a macro.  The macro would take a single parameter, which is the
argument expression.  The "name" of the argument could, presumably, be
extracted from the expression, and it's value compared to null reified.

@param argName Name of argument whose value is being verified.

@param argValue Argument value to be compared to `null`.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if '''argValue''' is `null`.

Require that argument value is valid.

Throw a [[java.lang.IllegalArgumentException]] if function parameter value is
invalid.

@note This function supersedes the [[scala.Predef#require()]] methods.

@note Tests for non-`null` argument values should be verified by the
`requireNonNull` function.

detailed, locale-specific explanation to the user.

@todo It would be nice, once Scala 2.10 is available, if this could be
converted into a macro.  The macro would take two parameters, the first being
the argument expression.  The "name" of the argument could, presumably, be
extracted from the expression, and it's value reified.

@param argName Name of argument whose value is being verified.

@param argValue Value of argument being verified.

@param isValid Flag representing the result of a condition determining the
validity of '''argValue'''.  If `true`, function merely returns; if `false` an
`IllegalArgumentException` is raised.

@throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if '''isValid''' is `false`.
