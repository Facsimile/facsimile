Qualifies the characteristics of a [[org.facsim.util.Version]].

Release phases determine the status of a release, with releases progressing
from one phase to the next without returning to a prior phase.  The Facsimile
library supports the following release phases, in increasing order of
stability:

 1. ''Alpha''.  Alpha releases are experimental, with one or more new features
    added.  They are unstable: newly added features may evolve or be removed
    and additional new features may be added.  They are completely unsuitable
    for production use and should be avoided by users, with their primary
    purpose being for evaluation by the developers.  Zero or more alpha
    releases may be made, differentiated by a serial revision number, prior to
    the release switching to the next phase.  This release phase is denoted by
    an `-alpha[-revision]` suffix to the version string, preceding the
    snapshot suffix (if any), where `revision` represents the alpha revision
    number.  If the revision number is omitted, it is assumed to be 0,
    representing the initial release.
 1. ''Beta''.  Beta releases provide previews of forthcoming new features.
    They are typically unstable, and the new functionality may change, or even
    be removed, prior to the final release, but no new features will be added
    once beta has been achieved.  They should not be used for production use,
    but users are encouraged to try the new features, report defects and
    comment upon their design and usability.  Zero or more beta releases may be
    made, differentiated by a serial revision number, prior to the release
    switching to the next phase.  This release phase is denoted by a
    `-beta[-revision]` suffix to the version string, preceding the snapshot
    suffix (if any), where `revision` represents the beta revision number.  If
    the revision number is omitted, it is assumed to be 0, representing the
    initial release.
 1. ''Release Candidate''.  Release candidates are releases that are believed
    stable enough to become final releases, but that do not yet have a stamp of
    approval.  Functionality should not change in the interval between a
    release candidate being made and any subsequent final release, with only
    bug-fixes being applied.  They are not recommended for production use, but
    users are encouraged to kick the tires by testing the release and reporting
    any defects found.  Zero or more release candidates may be made,
    differentiated by a serial revision number, prior to the release switching
    to the next phase.  This release phase is denoted by an `-rc[-revision]`
    suffix to the version string, preceding the snapshot suffix (if any), where
    `revision` represents the release candidate revision number.  If the
    revision number is omitted, it is assumed to be 0, representing the initial
    release.
 1. ''Final''.  Final releases should be stable.  They are recommended for
    production use and their quality can be relied upon.  New functionality
    will not be added to a final release, although subsequent bug-fix releases
    will be made over the period that the release is supported.  One or more
    final releases may be made, differentiated by a serial revision number,
    prior to the release switching to the next phase.  This release phase is
    denoted by a `[-revision]` suffix to the version string, preceding the
    snapshot suffix (if any), where `revision` represents the final release
    revision number.  If the revision number is omitted, it is assumed to be 0,
    representing the initial release.

Orthogonal to the release phase is the ''snapshot'' property.  Snapshots have
no quality guarantees associated with them and reflect development progress
towards the next release, regardless of its phase.  Snapshot releases are
denoted by a `-SNAPSHOT` or `-yyyyMMdd-hhmmss-n` suffix, (denoting the
timestamp of the snapshot release) which follows the release phase suffix.
