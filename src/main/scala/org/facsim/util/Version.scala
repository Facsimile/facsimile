/**
Encapsulate software version information, providing information about each
version's components.

=Version Formats=

Version numbering is based upon the model supported by the
[[http://maven.apache.org/ Maven]] software project management tool.
Specifically, supported version numbers are strings of the form:

{{{
M.m[.i][-phase][-r][-SNAPSHOT|-yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-b]
}}}

where:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>`M`</td>
    <td>Major version number.  This value cannot be negative.  A value of zero
    conventionally indicates that the software has yet to fulfill the basic
    functionality to achieve a ''1.0'' release.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`m`</td>
    <td>Minor version number.  This value cannot be negative.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`i`</td>
    <td>Incremental version number.  This value cannot be negative.  This field
    is optional.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`phase`</td>
    <td>Release phase.  If omitted, this indicates the ''final'' release phase;
    otherwise this may be one of the following: `alpha`, denoting an ''alpha''
    release phase; `beta`, denoting a ''beta'' release phase; or `rc` denoting
    a ''release candidate'' release phase.  No other release phases are
    currently supported.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`r`</td>
    <td>Revision version number.  This value cannot be negative.  This field is
    optional.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>`SNAPSHOT` or ``yyyyMMdd-HHmmss-s``</td>
    <td>Indicates a development snapshot.  ``SNAPSHOT`` will be present in
    unreleased builds from a project's source distribution, whereas the
    timestamp form is present in snapshot releases.  The timestamp, which is
    specified in [[ UTC]], has the following components:
    <table>
      <tr>
        <td>`yyyy`</td>
        <td>Year of snapshot release.
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`MM`</td>
        <td>Two-digit number representing month of year (01-12).
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`dd`</td>
        <td>Two-digit number representing day of month (01-31).
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`HH`</td>
        <td>Two-digit number representing hour of day (00-23).
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`mm`</td>
        <td>Two-digit number representing minute past hour (00-59).
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`ss`</td>
        <td>Two-digit number representing seconds past minute (00-59).
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>`s`</td>
        <td>One or more digits representing the sequential order in which
        timestamped snapshot releases were made (1+).  In practice, this value
        is almost always 1 and is discarded by this class.
      </tr>
    </table></td>
  </tr>
</table>

How these numbers are used depends upon the preferences and procedures of the
associated organization.  For further information, refer to

=Version Ordering=

It is often useful to order, or rank, software versions, for example to compare
two versions and determine the most up-to-date of the two.  This class supports
version number ordering, and operates as follows:

 1. If the major version numbers are different, then the version with the
    larger number is more up-to-date.
 1. Otherwise, if the minor version numbers are different, then the version
    with the larger number is more up-to-date.
 1. Otherwise, if the incremental version numbers are different, then the
    version with the larger number is more up-to-date.  (If no incremental
    number is present, it is treated as the value -1 for the purposes of
    comparison.)
 1. Otherwise, if the phases are different, then the versions are ranked by
    whichever phase is most up-to-date: ''final'' (most up-to-date), ''release
    candidate'', ''beta'', ''alpha'' (least up-to-date).
 1. Otherwise, if the revision numbers are different, then the version with the
    larger number is more up-to-date.
 1. Otherwise, if one version is a snapshot and the other is not, then the
    non-snapshot version is more up-to-date.
 1. Otherwise, if both versions are timestamped snapshots then the version
    with the more recent timestamp is more up-to-date.
 1. Otherwise, if both versions are snapshots, but one or the other has no
    timestamp, then it is impossible to compare the two and an exception is
    thrown.
 1. Otherwise, the two versions are the same.
