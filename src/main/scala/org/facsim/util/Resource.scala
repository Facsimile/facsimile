Retrieve and format a locale-specific string resource.

Retrieves the string resource corresponding to the supplied key from the

resulting string resource.  May be omitted if no arguments are required.

indexed by the supplied key.

/**
Retrieve an image file resource and return as an icon.

Typically, resource images are located in the images folder of the
application's, or library's, jar file.  For example, to retrieve an image
resource named "Icon.png" from such a directory, this function would be called
with a filename of "/images/Icon.png".

@note Resource files are typically not found unless they begin with a "/".
However, this is not enforced - expect to see a
[[java.util.MissingResourceException]] thrown if filename does not begin with a
slash.

@note In Java Swing, an ''icon'' is ''a small fixed size picture, typically
used to decorate components''.  This definition includes any images that may be
included in a Swing frame or dialog box, not just the square images associated
with a window or application/file.

@todo How should corrupt files be handled?  That is, what if the requested file
was found, but doesn't contain an image, or contains corrupt data?

@param filename File containing the image to be retrieved.

@return Retrieved image, if successful.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if filename is null.

@throws java.util.MissingResourceException if there is no resource with the
indicated file name.  In many cases, this exception will be thrown if filename
does not begin with a slash.

@note Images resources are not stored in resource bundles.
