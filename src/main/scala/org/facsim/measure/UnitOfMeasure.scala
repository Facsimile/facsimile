/**
Abstract base class for all measurement types.

Each subclass represents a single _measurement type_ - a physical quantity such
as ''time'', ''distance'', ''velocity'', etc.

Each type supports one or more units of measure.  For example, time quantities
may be measured in ''seconds'', ''minutes'', ''hours'', etc.  These units are
represented by instances of the implementing measurement type's class.  For
each measurement type, there is a standard unit of measure defined by the
$SI_FULL - commonly abbreviated as $SI.

These standard units are used by $FACSIMILE internally to store measurement
quantities.  (Measurement quantities are stored as immutable instances of
[measure.Measure Measure] subclasses, with each subclass corresponding to each
measurement type.)  For example, the $SI standard unit of measure for ''time''
is the ''second''; consequently, $FACSIMILE stores and calculates all time
quantities in ''seconds'' also.  Adoption of the $SI standard units simplifies
the implementation of physics calculations within $FACSIMILE and provides a
clearly-defined basis for developing simulation models of the real-world.
(Many other simulation modeling tools suffer from unit of measure confusion,
both internally and externally, creating a wide variety of problems.)

However, it is unreasonable to expect that $FACSIMILE users would be
comfortable entering and reviewing data solely in these units.  For instance,
the $SI standard unit of measure for ''angles'' is the ''radian'' - and there
are few people who don't find the ''degree'' a far more intuitive alternative.
Similarly, users in the United States might prefer to use feet & inches,
pounds, Fahrenheit, etc. instead of their metric equivalents.  Consequently,
$FACSIMILE allows users to work with whichever units they - or their customers
or employers - prefer.  $FACSIMILE converts values to the standard $SI units on
input and converts them to the required units on output.

@param nameSingular Singular form of the unit name.  This name should be in the
closest match to the user's preferred locale.

@param namePlural Plural form of the unit name.  This name should be in the
closest match to the user's preferred locale.

@param symbol Symbol for this unit.  This name should be in the closest match
to the user's preferred locale.
