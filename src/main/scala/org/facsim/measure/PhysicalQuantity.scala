Since measurements have a value and a family, we take the hash code of each an
use a binary XOR on them to obtain our hash code.  This ensures that
measurements from different families, which do not compare equal, have
different hashes while also ensuring that equal values for the same families,
which do compare equal, have identical hash codes too.  This fulfills the hash
code/equality contract.

I (Mike) don't think that there is a need to compare measurements to doubles
(generic, unitless measurements are, in effect, the same as Doubles), since we
can implicitly convert either to the other, but I could be wrong., but we cab

/**
Abstract base class for all physical quantity measurement units.

Each subclass represents a single ''physical quantity unit family''.  For
example, time units are represented by the
[[org.facsim.measure.Time.TimeUnit!]] `AbstractUnits` subclass.

Each unit family supports one or more ''units of measure''.  For example, time
quantities may be measured in ''seconds'', ''minutes'', ''hours'', etc.  These
units are represented by instances of the concrete `AbstractUnits` subclass.
For each unit family, there is a standard unit of measure defined by the
''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI International System of
Units]]''&mdash;commonly abbreviated to ''SI Units''.

These standard units are used by ''Facsimile'' internally to store measurement
quantities (as immutable instances of
[[org.facsim.measure.PhysicalQuantity.AbstractMeasure!]] subclasses, with each
subclass corresponding to each measurement type.)  For example, the ''SI''
standard unit of measure for ''time'' is the ''second''; consequently,
''Facsimile'' stores and calculates all time quantities, internally, in
''seconds''.  Adoption of the ''SI'' standard units simplifies the
implementation of physics calculations within ''Facsimile'' and provides a
clearly-defined basis for developing simulation models of the real-world.
(Many other simulation modeling tools suffer from ''unit of measure
confusion'', both internally and externally, creating a wide variety of
problems.)

However, it is unreasonable to expect that ''Facsimile'' users would be
comfortable entering and reviewing data solely in these units.  For instance,
the ''SI'' standard unit of measure for ''angles'' is the ''radian''$mdash;and
there are few people who don't find the ''degree'' a far more intuitive
alternative.  Similarly, users in the United States&mdash;or their
customers$mdash;might prefer ''feet'' & ''inches'', ''pounds'', ''Fahrenheit'',
etc. to their metric equivalents.  Consequently, ''Facsimile'' allows users to
work with whichever units they prefer.  ''Facsimile'' converts values to the
standard ''SI'' units on input and converts them to the required units on
output.
