/**
Unit of measurement value converter trait.

Converter implementations support the conversion of measurement quantity values
between different measurement units of the same type.  For example, converting
a ''time'' expressed in ''hours'' to a time expressed in ''seconds''.

More specifically, each converter instance is associated with a specific
measurement unit.  They support the conversion of values between this
associated measurement unit and the standard ''SI'' units for the associated
type of measurement.

Refer to [[org.facsim.measure.UnitOfMeasure UnitOfMeasure]] for further
information.
