Abstract base class for all non-negative measurement type classes.

Measurement value type sub-classes cannot have negative values, which is a
useful characteristic of many measurement types (including [[Time]],
[[Temperature]], [[Mass]] etc.).

@param value Value of the measurement type in the corresponding $SI units.

@tparam T Actual measurement type.  This must be a sub-type of
NonNegativeMeasure.
