Class representing a physical quantity family defined in terms of exponents of
base units.

An instance having only zero base measure exponents has no units; i.e. it is
''unitless''.

private and should be called only from the
[[org.facsim.measure.Family$.apply(Vector[Int])*]]

existing instances rather than create new instances on each call.
