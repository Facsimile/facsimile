/**
Linear factor unit of measure value converter.

Converts between measurement values between different units (belonging to the
same measurement type) using a linear factor.

To import a value, that is, to convert a measurement quantity's value from the
units associated with this converter to a value in the standard $SI units for
the associated measurement type, the value is multiplied by the given
'''factor'''.

To export a value, that is, to convert a measurement quantity's value from the
standard $SI units for the associated measurement type to a value in the units
associated with this converter, the value is divided by the given '''factor'''.

@param factor Linear conversion factor.  This value cannot be zero.

@since 0.0-0
