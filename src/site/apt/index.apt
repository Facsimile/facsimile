Facsimile Simulation Suite

  The <Facsimile> project's goal is to develop and maintain a high-quality, 3D,
  discrete-event simulation library that can be used for industrial simulation
  projects in an engineering and/or manufacturing environment.

  <Facsimile> simulations run on <Microsoft Windows> as well as on <Linux>,
  <MacOS>, <BSD> and <Unix>.

  <Facsimile> is open-source/free software and is distributed under version 3
  of the {{{http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html}GNU Lesser General Public
