 * SBT build configuration that is common to all Facsimile projects.
 *
 * Project-specific build configuration should be placed in a project root-level SBT file named after the project (such
 * as Facsimile.sbt, for example).
 *
 * The word "project" is a little over-used in this file, potentially resulting in some confusion. It can refer to a
 * library or tool that has a separate git repository in Facsimile's GitHub organization (such that this file defines
 * the build framework for that project). But it can also refer to an SBT project or sub-project - particularly in
 * multi-project builds. We'll try to make the context as obvious as possible, but the phrases "Facsimile project",
 * "this project" and "project-specific" will typically refer to a library/tool, while "root project", "multi-project",
 * "source project", "sub-project" will typically refer to SBT usage. Hope we've cleared that up... ;-)
 *
 * NOTE: This file is maintained as part of the Facsimile "skeleton" project, and is common to a number of other
 * Facsimile projects, termed client projects. It must only be modified in the "skeleton" project, with changes being
 * merged into client projects. Refer to the skeleton project for further details:
