Scala compiler options.

This is a conundrum: -Xfatal-warnings is essential, since it forces all
warnings to be addressed. However, when -optimize is specified, Scala will
generate some inline warnings when initializing large maps (such as the cell
code to cell type map in org.facsim.anim.cell.CellScene). Although the inline
warnings themselves will only be issued when -Yinline-warnings is specified,
Scala will still emit a warning that inline warnings occurred, which is then
treated as fatal by Xfatal-warnings. It seems that the only way around this,
right now, is to disable -Xfatal-warnings. This is a known Scala compiler issue
documented at https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-6723.

-Xfatal-warnings is also disabled since there were some deliberate decisions
taken (such as using the deprecated DelayedInit trait in org.facsim.App)
resulting in warnings that cannot currently be suppressed. (The Scala team have
been deprecating a lot of features as of 2.11, but there are no alternatives to
many of the deprecated classes, which is becoming a nuisance.)

As Xfatal-warnings is not in use, it's possible to have builds that generate
tons of warnings, but which do not fail a build. This is unacceptable.
Facsimile must build clean, without any errors or warnings, as a basic
requirement for any release to be performned.

-Xstrict-inference is currently disabled as it outputs some erroneous warnings
for some generic code. See https://issues.scala-lang.org/browse/SI-7991 for
further details.

NOTES:
1.  Test artifacts should NOT be published. This is disabled by the line
    "publishArtifact in Test := false" below.
2.  Third-party artifacts referenced by Facsimile that are not available in the
    Maven Central Repository should not be listed in a project's POM file. If
    such artifacts are required, then uncomment the "pomIncludeRepository"
    setting so that the repositories from which they're referenced are ignored.
3.  Maven metadata that is not defined by SBT properties must be defined in the
    "pomExtra" setting as XML.
4.  Artifacts must be signed via GPG to be published to the Sonatype OSS Nexus.
    For security reasons (to prevent signing of unauthorized), this must be
    configured locally on each release manager's machine. In this case, the
    software must be signed using the key for "software@facsim.org" - with
    public key "797D614C". (If your version of Facsimile is signed by a
    different key, then you do not have the official version.)

We publish to the snapshots repository, if this is a snapshot, or to the
releases staging repository if this is an official release (or a committed
version - which seems wrong, right now).
