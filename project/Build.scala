Maven POM (project object model) metadata.

This information is required in order to deploy the project on the Sonatype OSS
Nexus repository, which ensures that the project is synchronized with the Maven
Central Repository.

NOTES:
1.  Test artifacts should NOT be published. This is disabled by the line
    "publishArtifact in Test := false" below.
2.  Third-party artifacts referenced by Facsimile that are not available in the
    Maven Central Repository should not be listed in a project's POM file. If
    such artifacts are required, then uncomment the "pomIncludeRepository"
    setting so that the repositories from which they're referenced are ignored.
3.  Maven metadata that is not defined by SBT properties must be defined in the
    "pomExtra" setting as XML.
4.  Artifacts must be signed via GPG to be published to the Sonatype OSS Nexus.
    For security reasons (to prevent signing of unauthorized), this must be
    configured locally on each release manager's machine. In this case, the
    software must be signed using the key for "software@facsim.org" - with
    public key "797D614C". (If your version of Facsimile is signed by a
    different key, then you do not have the official version.)
