// SBT sbt-git plugin.
//
// This plugin provides support for using git commit SHA codes for versioning
// builds, which is essential for ensuring that the "git bisect" command
// functions correctly.
//
// This plugin implements the behavior outlined by Josh Suereth (one of SBT's
// authors) in his Scala Days 2013 presentation, "Effective SBT". Refer to the
// following link for his presentation:
