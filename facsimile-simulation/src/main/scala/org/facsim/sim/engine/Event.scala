/** Event scheduling the dispatch of specified actions at a specified simulation time.
 *
 *  @tparam M Final type of the simulation's model state.
 *
 *  @note This class is considered an internal, implementation class. It is not a part of the _Facsimile_ public API,
 *  and should not be exposed to the user; the rationale for this is that it keeps the API simpler.
 *
 *  @constructor Create an event instance to ensure that an action to change the simulation state is performed at a
 *  specified time in the future.
 *
 *  @param id Unique identifier for this event. As well as uniquely identifying each event, `id` values serve to record
 *  event creation order, such that when comparing two events, that with the lower `id` value was the first of the two
 *  be scheduled.
 *
 *  @param dueAt Absolute simulation time at which the event's `action` is scheduled to occur.
 *
 *  @param priority Relative priority of this event. The lower this value, the higher the priority of the associated
 *  event. Co-incidental events will be dispatched in order of their priority.
 *
 *  @param action Action to be performed by this event when it is dispatched.

   *
   *  When comparing two events that have yet to occur, the event that compares as ''less than'' the other event must
   *  always be dispatched first.
   *
   *  @note It is possible for an event that is occurring, or that has already occurred, to compare as ''greater than''
   *  an event that has yet to occur, but only if the latter was scheduled ''after'' the former was dispatched. Even so,
   *  since time cannot run backwards, the latter cannot be due at an earlier time than the former.
   *
   *  @param that Event that this event is being compared to.
   *
   *  @return An integer value indicating the result of the comparison. If this value is less than zero, then this event
   *  compares as ''less than'' `that` event; if this value is greater than zero, then this event compares as ''greater
   *  than'' `that` event. Two events should ''never'' compare as equal (unless they are the same instance), since the
   *  event's [[id]] must be unique.
