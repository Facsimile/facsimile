/** Configuration of the ''Facsimile'' application and simulation run.
 *
 *  ''Facsimile'' has a number of standard command line options whose state is represented by the final instance of this
 *  class.
 *
 *  Command line configuration indicates whether a ''GUI'' animation will be provided, the name of the ''HOCON''
 *  simulation configuration file to be used to configure this simulation run, etc.
 *
 *  @note For further details of the command line options available, run the simulation application with the single
 *  command line option, `--help`.
 *
 *  @constructor Create a new Facsimile configuration instance.
 *
 *  @param configFile ''HOCON'' configuration file to be used to configure the simulation, wrapped in `[[scala.Some
 *  Some]]`, or `[[scala.None None]]` if the simulation is to solely use command line ''Java''-style configuration
 *  properties and/or default configuration values.
 *
 *  @param logFile File into which log information should be written, wrapped in `[[scala.Some  Some]]`, or
 *  `[[scala.None None]]` if the simulation should not write any log information.
 *
 *  @param logLevel Default log severity level when recording log messages; only log messages at or above the indicated
 *  severity level will be written into the log file. If `useGui` is false, this also defines the log level for writing
 *  log messages to the standard output.
 *
 *  @param reportFile Simulation report file to be generated by this run, wrapped in `[[scala.Some Some]]`, or
 *  `[[scala.None None]]` if the simulation is not to issue a report for this run.
 *
 *  @param runModel Flag indicating whether the program should run this simulation. Typically, this will not happen if
 *  the user has requested the program version or help information; otherwise the simulation should be run.
 *
 *  @param showVersion Flag indicating whether program version information should be displayed at the start of the run.
 *  By default, no version information will be displayed.
 *
 *  @param showUsage Flag indicating whether program usage information should be displayed at the start of the run. By
 *  default, no usage information will be displayed.
 *
 *  @param useGUI Flag indicating whether a ''graphical user interface'' (''GUI'') is to be utilized to control and view
 *  the simulation.
