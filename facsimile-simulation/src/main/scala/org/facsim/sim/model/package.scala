/** ''Facsimile Simulation Library'' model package.
 *
 *  Package containing simulation modeling elements, their actions and location in 3D space.
 *
 *  =Note on Orientation=
 *
 *  In ''Facsimile'', the ''world'' axes are oriented as follows:
 *
 *   - X-Axis: Positive X-axis points to the ''East'', negative to the ''West''.
 *   - Y-Axis: Positive Y-axis points to the ''North'', negative to the ''South''.
 *   - Z-Axis: Positive Z-axis points ''Up'', negative points ''Down''.
 *
 *  This is the same ''right-handed orientation'' convention adopted by ''3D Studio'', ''AutoCAD'' and ''AutoMod''
 *  among others.
 *
 *  Note that ''JavaFX'' utilizes the following unusual axis orientation:
 *
 *   - X-Axis: Positive X-axis points to the ''East'', negative to the ''West''.
 *   - Y-Axis: Positive Z-axis points ''Up'', negative points ''Down''.
 *   - Z-Axis: Positive Y-axis points to the ''South'', negative to the ''North''.
 *
 *  Transformations must be applied to the 3D model in order to accurately render the same scene in ''JavaFX''.
