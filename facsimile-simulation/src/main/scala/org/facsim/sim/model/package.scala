/** _Facsimile Simulation Library_ model package.
 *
 *  Package containing simulation modeling elements, their actions and location in 3D space.
 *
 *  =Note on Orientation=
 *
 *  In _Facsimile_, the _world_ axes are oriented as follows:
 *
 *   - X-Axis: Positive X-axis points to the _East_, negative to the _West_.
 *   - Y-Axis: Positive Y-axis points to the _North_, negative to the _South_.
 *   - Z-Axis: Positive Z-axis points _Up_, negative points _Down_.
 *
 *  This is the same _right-handed orientation_ convention adopted by _3D Studio_, _AutoCAD_ and _AutoMod_
 *  among others.
 *
 *  Note that _JavaFX_ utilizes the following unusual axis orientation:
 *
 *   - X-Axis: Positive X-axis points to the _East_, negative to the _West_.
 *   - Y-Axis: Positive Z-axis points _Up_, negative points _Down_.
 *   - Z-Axis: Positive Y-axis points to the _South_, negative to the _North_.
 *
 *  Transformations must be applied to the 3D model in order to accurately render the same scene in _JavaFX_.
