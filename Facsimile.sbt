  The Facsimile project's goal is to develop and maintain a high-quality, 3D, discrete-event simulation library that can
  be used for industrial simulation projects in an engineering and/or manufacturing environment.

  Facsimile simulations run on Microsoft Windows as well as on Linux, Mac OS, BSD and Unix on the Java virtual machine.
