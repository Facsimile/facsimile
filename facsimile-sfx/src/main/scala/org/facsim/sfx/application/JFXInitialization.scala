/** Base trait for initializing _JavaFX_.

 *  achieve this, the execution of such code must be delayed until after the _JavaFX_ `javafx.application.Application`
 *  instance has been created and initialized. However, the construction code for traits that extend this trait will be
 *  executed upon construction, on the current thread, in the normal manner. This functionality is provided by the
 *  [[DelayedInit]] trait.
