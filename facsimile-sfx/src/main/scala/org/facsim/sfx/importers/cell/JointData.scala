/** ''Cell'' element's joint data.
 *
 *  Stores the current ''cell'' element's dynamic ''joint'' and/or ''terminal control frame'' (''TCF'') data.
 *
 *  @note The `jointTransform`, which typically comprises solely rotational transformations, is used to align the
 *  joint's local Z-axis with the axis of motion. Translational joints translate the joint along this axis, while
 *  rotational joints rotate about this axis. Similarly, the `tcfTransform` is used to position and orient elements
 *  that are dynamically added to the element with this joint information.
 *
 *  @constructor Create a new ''cell'' joint data instance.
 *
 *  @param joint Type of joint represented.
 *
 *  @param speed Maximum speed (in translational distance units, or rotational units measured in ''degrees'', per time
 *  unit) for motion along the joint.
 *
 *  @param range Range of joint motion, together with current (initial) displacement.
 *
 *  @param jointTransform Sequence of transformations to be applied to joint's motion.
 *
 *  @param tcfTransform Sequence of transformations to be applied to associated ''TCF'' (if any).
