/** Safe replacement for the ''Scala'' `[[scala.Char Char]]` primitive type and for the underlying ''Java'' `char`
 *  primitive type.
 *
 *  The ''Java'' `char` type consumes two bytes of storage and was originally intended to represent the full range of
 *  ''[[https://unicode.org Unicode]]'' characters. Unfortunately, after the type was defined, the ''Unicode'' standard
 *  was extended to include such a large range of characters that two bytes (16 bits) became insufficient to store every
 *  possible character; now, many ''Unicode'' characters have codepoints that exceed 16 bits.
 *
 *  As a direct consequence, ''Java''&mdash;and hence ''Scala'' and all other ''JVM'' languages&mdash;now have a very
 *  ugly issue to deal with: there is no longer a direct mapping between a single `char` value and a single ''Unicode''
 *  character. Some ''Unicode'' characters are represented by a sequence of two `char`s&mhash;the first termed a ''high
 *  surrogate character'' and the second, a ''low surrogate character''. Processing `[[java.lang.String String]]` values
 *  as though they are sequences of `char` values is now complex and, consequently, buggy.
 *
 *  The solution that the ''Facsimile'' library has adopted is to replace the use of `Char` values with a new value
 *  type&mdash;`UChar`&mdash; that utilizes 4 bytes (32 bits) to store individual character values. As a result,
 *  processing of string and character values is now much simpler. (Admittedly, processing character strings in this
 *  manner does require additional memory; however, this overhead is slight in practice, memory is cheap, address space
 *  is large and the elimination of a whole class of bugs is viewed as a price worth paying.)
 *
 *  In ''Facsimile'', use of `Char` is deprecated.
 *
 *  @constructor Create a new ''Unicode'' character instance.
 *
 *  @param codepoint ''Unicode'' codepoint of this character. This should be a valid ''Unicode'' codepoint (as defined
 *  by `[[org.facsim.util.types.CharU.isValid isValid]]`), but cannot be validated except manually.
 *
