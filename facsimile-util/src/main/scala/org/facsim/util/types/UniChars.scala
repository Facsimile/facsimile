  /** Encapsulates a single, valid, non-_surrogate [[https://unicode.org/ Unicode]]_ character.
   *
   *  _Java_ (and, hence, _Scala_, _Kotlin_ and other _JVM_ languages) suffer from a broken `char` implementation (and
   *  hence also the [[Character]] and [[Char]] type implementations).
   *
   *  In the early days of _Java_, a decision was made to support the then new _Unicode_ standard. At that time, a
   *  single _Unicode_ character required only 16 bits of storage capacity (two 8-bit bytes) to encode all of its
   *  characters. Consequently, _Java_ defined a `char` to be 2 bytes in size, and each _Unicode_ character mapped to a
   *  single `char` value. Simple!
   *
   *  Alas, since then, as more and more characters have been added to the _Unicode_ standard, some characters now
   *  require more than 16 bits in order to be encoded (the reference number for a character is termed a _codepoint_).
   *  At the time of writing, the [[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode15.1.0/ current _Unicode_ standard (15.1.0)]]
   *  defines characters with codepoints in the range [0x000000, 0x10FFFF], requiring 21 bits of storage for any single
   *  character. Rather than break compatibility with earlier versions of _Java_, it was decided to break the
   *  relationship that mapped a single _Unicode_ character to a single _Java_ `char` value. Now, some _Unicode_
   *  characters must be represented by a _surrogate pair_ of _Java_ `char` values (this is also referred to as _UTF-16
   *  encoding_). Each pair consists of a _high-surrogate_ (or _leading surrogate_) character and a _low-surrogate_ (or
   *  _trailing surrogate_) character; each surrogate character by itself is meaningless and the presence of surrogates
   *  that do not form a pair indicates an encoding error.
   *
   *  The presence of surrogate characters leads to a number of gnarly programming problems when processing [[String]]s
   *  as sequences of `char` values. In essence, the `char` type is broken and is no longer fit for purpose. To work
   *  around this, _Facsimile_ has created a new character data type, called [[UniChar]], to represent individual
   *  _Unicode_ characters, replacing the `char` type (and the _Java_ `Character` and _Scala_ `Char` types). [[UniChar]]
   *  instances are based upon the _codepoint_ value of each _Unicode_ character, in the form of a 4-byte (32-bit)
   *  integer value.
   *
   *  As a consequence, every [[UniChar]] instance is a valid, non-surrogate _Unicode_ character, simplifying string
   *  parsing operations.
   *
   *  @see [[https://unicode.org/ Unicode standard.]]
