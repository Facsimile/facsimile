/** Encapsulates a single, valid, non-_surrogate [[https://unicode.org/ Unicode]]_ character.
 *
 *  _Java_ (and, hence, _Scala_, _Kotlin_ and other _JVM_ languages) suffer from a broken `char` implementation
 *  (and hence also the `[[Character]]` and `[[Char]]` type implementations).
 *
 *  In the early days of _Java_, a decision was made to support the then new _Unicode_ standard. At that time, a
 *  single _Unicode_ character required only 16 bits of storage capacity (two 8-bit bytes) to encode all of its
 *  characters. Consequently, _Java_ defined a `char` to be 2 bytes in size, and each _Unicode_ character mapped to
 *  a single `char` value. Simple!
 *
 *  Alas, since then, as more and more characters have been added to the _Unicode_ standard, some characters now
 *  require more than 16 bits in order to be encoded (the reference number for a character is termed a _codepoint_).
 *  At the time of writing, the [[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ current _Unicode_ standard (13.0.0)]]
 *  defines characters with codepoints in the range [0x000000, 0x10FFFF], requiring 21 bits of storage for any single
 *  character. Rather than break compatibility with earlier versions of _Java_, it was decided to break the
 *  relationship that mapped a single _Unicode_ character to a single _Java_ `char` value. Now, some _Unicode_
 *  characters must be represented by a _surrogate pair_ of _Java_ `char` values (this is also referred to as
 *  _UTF-16 encoding_). Each pair consists of a _high-surrogate_ (or _leading surrogate_) character and a
 *  _low-surrogate_ (or _trailing surrogate_) characters; each surrogate character by itself is meaningless and
 *  the presence of surrogates that do not form a pair indicates an encoding error.
 *
 *  The presence of surrogate characters leads to a number of gnarly programming problems when processing `[[String]]`s
 *  as sequences of `char` values. In essence, the `char` type is broken and is no longer fit for purpose. To work
 *  around this, _Facsimile_ has created a new character data type, called `UniChar`, to represent individual
 *  _Unicode_ characters, replacing the `char` type (and the _Java_ `Character` and _Scala_ `Char` types).
 *  `UniChar` instances are based upon the _codepoint_ value of each _Unicode_ character, in the form of a 4-byte
 *  (32-bit) integer value.
 *
 *  As a consequence, every `UniChar` instance is a valid, non-surrogate _Unicode_ character, simplifying string
 *  parsing operations.
 *
 *  @note This class should be used to assist with per-character parsing operations. It is not intended for use as a
 *  means of storing character data, or for replacement of _Java_ `[[String]]`s.
 *
 *  @constructor Create a new, single _Unicode_ character from a _Unicode_ `codepoint`. If `codepoint` does not
 *  represent a defined _Unicode_ character, or if it is defined but represents a _surrogate_ character, then an
 *  exception will be thrown.
 *
 *  @param codepoint _Unicode_ codepoint value of the corresponding character. Invalid codepoints, and codepoints for
 *  surrogate characters, will be rejected by the associated factory methods.
 *
 *  @throws IllegalArgumentException if `codepoint` is not a defined, non-surrogate _Unicode_ codepoint.
 *
 *  @see _[[https://unicode.org/ Unicode standard.]]_

 *  @since 0.2

// Developer note: To improve the efficiency of this type, it was originally made a value class (by extending AnyVal).
// However, it was decided to move away from that, for the following reasons:
// 1. Value classes cannot have any constructor code, and so cannot validate their arguments. One of the key design
//    goals for the UniChar type was to be able to reject invalid codepoints, and so this would not have been possible.
// 2. There is the possibility of type confusion for implicit conversion methods, if the underlying base class is Int.
//
// It might be possible to review this decision in future releases should performance be identified as a significant
// issue. Alternatively, class methods could be inlined and benchmarked to also address performance.
