/** Encapsulates a single, valid, non-''surrogate [[https://unicode.org/ Unicode]]'' character.
 *
 *  ''Java'' (and, hence, ''Scala'', ''Kotlin'' and other ''JVM'' languages) suffer from a broken `char` implementation
 *  (and hence also the `[[Character]]` and `[[Char]]` type implementations).
 *
 *  In the early days of ''Java'', a decision was made to support the then new ''Unicode'' standard. At that time, a
 *  single ''Unicode'' character required only 16 bits of storage capacity (two 8-bit bytes) to encode all of its
 *  characters. Consequently, ''Java'' defined a `char` to be 2 bytes in size, and each ''Unicode'' character mapped to
 *  a single `char` value. Simple!
 *
 *  Alas, since then, as more and more characters have been added to the ''Unicode'' standard, some characters now
 *  require more than 16 bits in order to be encoded (the reference number for a character is termed a ''codepoint'').
 *  At the time of writing, the [[http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode13.0.0/ current ''Unicode'' standard (13.0.0)]]
 *  defines characters with codepoints in the range [0x000000, 0x10FFFF], requiring 21 bits of storage for any single
 *  character. Rather than break compatibility with earlier versions of ''Java'', it was decided to break the
 *  relationship that mapped a single ''Unicode'' character to a single ''Java'' `char` value. Now, some ''Unicode''
 *  characters must be represented by a ''surrogate pair'' of ''Java'' `char` values (this is also referred to as
 *  ''UTF-16 encoding''). Each pair consists of a ''high-surrogate'' (or ''leading surrogate'') character and a
 *  ''low-surrogate'' (or ''trailing surrogate'') characters; each surrogate character by itself is meaningless and
 *  the presence of surrogates that do not form a pair indicates an encoding error.
 *
 *  The presence of surrogate characters leads to a number of gnarly programming problems when processing `[[String]]`s
 *  as sequences of `char` values. In essence, the `char` type is broken and is no longer fit for purpose. To work
 *  around this, ''Facsimile'' has created a new character data type, called `UniChar`, to represent individual
 *  ''Unicode'' characters, replacing the `char` type (and the ''Java'' `Character` and ''Scala'' `Char` types).
 *  `UniChar` instances are based upon the ''codepoint'' value of each ''Unicode'' character, in the form of a 4-byte
 *  (32-bit) integer value.
 *
 *  As a consequence, every `UniChar` instance is a valid, non-surrogate ''Unicode'' character, simplifying string
 *  parsing operations.
 *
 *  @note This class should be used to assist with per-character parsing operations. It is not intended for use as a
 *  means of storing character data, or for replacement of ''Java'' `[[String]]`s.
 *
 *  @constructor Create a new, single ''Unicode'' character from a ''Unicode'' `codepoint`. If `codepoint` does not
 *  represent a defined ''Unicode'' character, or if it is defined but represents a ''surrogate'' character, then an
 *  exception will be thrown.
 *
 *  @param codepoint ''Unicode'' codepoint value of the corresponding character. Invalid codepoints, and codepoints for
 *  surrogate characters, will be rejected by the associated factory methods.
 *
 *  @throws IllegalArgumentException if `codepoint` is not a defined, non-surrogate ''Unicode'' codepoint.
 *
 *  @see ''[[https://unicode.org/ Unicode standard.]]''

// Developer note: To improve the efficiency of this type, it was originally made a value class (by extending AnyVal).
// However, it was decided to move away from that, for the following reasons:
// 1. Value classes cannot have any constructor code, and so cannot validate their arguments. One of the key design
//    goals for the UniChar type was to be able to reject invalid codepoints, and so this would not have been possible.
// 2. There is the possibility of type confusion for implicit conversion methods, if the underlying base class is Int.
//
// It might be possible to review this decision in future releases should performance be identified as a significant
// issue. Alternatively, class methods could be inlined and benchmarked to also address performance.
