/** Safe replacement for the _Scala_ [[scala.Char]] primitive type and for the underlying _Java_ `char` primitive type.
 *
 *  The _Java_ `char` type consumes two bytes of storage and was originally intended to represent the full range of
 *  ''[[https://unicode.org]] Unicode'' characters. Unfortunately, after the type was defined, the ''Unicode'' standard
 *  was extended to include such a large range of characters that two bytes (16 bits) became insufficient to store every
 *  possible character; now, many ''Unicode'' characters have codepoints that exceed 16 bits.
 *
 *  As a direct consequence, _Java_&mdash;and hence _Scala_ and all other ''JVM'' languages&mdash;now have a very ugly
 *  issue to deal with: there is no longer a direct mapping between a single `char` value and a single ''Unicode''
 *  character. Some ''Unicode'' characters are represented by a sequence of two `char`s&mhash;the first termed a ''high
 *  surrogate character'' and the second, a ''low surrogate character''. Processing [[scala.String]] values are though
 *  they are sequences of `char` values is now complex and, consequently, buggy.
 *
 *  The solution that the ''Facsimile'' library has adopted is to replace the use of [[scala.Char]] values with a new
 *  value type&mash;UChar`&mdash; that utilizes 4 bytes (32 bits) to store individual character values. As a result,
 *  processing of string and character values is now much simpler. (Admittedly, this does require additional memory to
 *  process character strings. However, this overhead is slight in practice, memory is cheap, address space is large and
 *  the elimination of a whole class of bugs is viewed as a price worth paying.
 *
 *  In ''Facsimile'', use of [[scala.Char]] is deprecated.
 *
 *  @param codepoint ''Unicode'' codepoint of this character. This must be a valid ''Unicode'' codepoint (as defined by
 *  [[org.facsim.util.types.UChar.isValid()]]) or an exception will be thrown.
 *
 *  @throws scala.IllegalArgumentException if `codepoint` is not valid.
