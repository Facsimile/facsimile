 * Encapsulate software version information, providing information about each version's components.

 * permit version ordering, and determinations of whether this is a snapshot version, a pre-release version, etc. For
 * now, we just report back whatever string we're assigned.
 *
 * @constructor Construct new version from raw version string. This will change shortly. The recommended way to create
 * version instances is via [[org.facsim.util.Version.apply(String)*]].
