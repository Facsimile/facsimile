/**
 * Test behaviors for [[Equals]] trait-implementing classes.
 *
 * This trait can be used as part of the test suite for a class that must honor the ''equals contract'':
 *
 * - ''Reflexive'': `x == x` should be true for various non-`null` `x` of the associated type.
 * - ''Symmetric'': `x == y` and `y == x` should both give the same, expected answer for various non-`null` `x` & `y`.
 * - ''Transitive'': `x == y`, `y == z` and `x == z` should all give the same, expected answer for various non-`null`
 * `x`, `y` & `z`.
 * - ''Consistent'': `x == y` must always hold `true`, or always hold `false`, if `x` & `y` are not modified
 * (guaranteed if `x` & `y` are immutable).
 * - `x != y` if `x` and `y` are not comparable objects, regardless of contents, for various non-`null` `x` & `y`.
 * - `x != null` for various non-`null` `x`. Should not see [[NullPointerException]] thrown.
 * - If `x == y`, then verify also that `x.hashMap = y.hashMap`, for various non-`null` `x` & `y`.
 * - etc.
 *
 * @tparam V Type, implementing the [[Equals]] trait, to be tested.
