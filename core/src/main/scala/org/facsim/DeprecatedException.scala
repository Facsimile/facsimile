/**
Thrown if use of deprecated feature is attempted.

@note This exception should only be thrown in extreme cases.  Not every
''deprecated'' class or function should throw this exception when referenced;
if so, releases containing newly deprecated features would break a lot of
existing user models&mdash;and that would not be good!  Instead, it should only
be thrown only if a previously deprecated feature becomes unsupportable, or if
a feature is deliberately unsupported from day one of its use.

@constructor Create new deprecation  exception.

@param feature Feature (typically a class, constructor, function, trait,
object, etc.) that has been flagged as being both deprecated and unsupported.
