Provide a set of icons for the executing application.

By default, the icons for the ''Facsimile'' project are provided. To customize
the application icons, this function should be overridden and a custom icon set
returned instead. If an empty set of icons are provided, then the application
will use the default ''JavaFX'' application icon set.

For highest quality icon rendering, a number of different size icons (measured
in ''pixels'') should be returned. Note that not all sizes are required for all
platforms, but it is recommended that all of the following sizes are provided:

 - 16x16
 - 32x32
 - 48x48
 - 64x64
 - 128x128
 - 256x256
 - 512x512
 - 1024x1024

The most appropriate size will be selected selected automatically. All icon
sizes should contain the same image (although some simplification may be
required for smaller icon sizes).

@note This function will only be called if the application is running as a
''GUI'' application.

@return A list of images to be utilized as application icons.
