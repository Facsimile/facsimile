/**
Implicit conversion of a [[java.time.ZonedDateTime]] to a [[java.util.Date]].

For some reason best known only to themselves, conversion between older
`java.util` time classes (such as [[java.util.Date]],
[[java.util.GregorianCalendar]], etc.) and the new `java.time` time classes
[[java.time.Instant]], [[java.time.ZonedDateTime]], etc) is cumbersome at best.
The former could be dispensed with completly if if wasn't for the fact that
only the `java.util.Date` class is supported by [[java.text.MessageFormat]].

@param date Date, expressed as a [[java.time.ZonedDateTime]] to be converted.

@return `date` expressed as a [[java.util.Date]].
