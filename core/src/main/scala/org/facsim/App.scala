/**
Application trait.

Provide common information and functionality for applications built with the
''Facsimile'' library.

`App` employs the common ''Scala cake pattern'' to avoid hard-coding
dependencies and to instead employ
''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection dependency injection]]''
to provide access to facilities that may not be available at compile-time. In
order to compile, client applications '''must''' mix-in an
[[org.facsim.AppInformation]]-implementation instance when creating an
application ''object'' from this trait.

The application may utilize a graphical user interface, or be driven from the
command line, or both, depending upon the registered behavior.
