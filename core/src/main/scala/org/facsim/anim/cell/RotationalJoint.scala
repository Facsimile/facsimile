/**
Class representing a ''rotational joint''.

A ''rotational joint'' allows children of the associated ''cell'' primitive be
rotated about the joint's local Z-axis under kinematic control.

@see [[http://facsim.org/Documentation/Resources/AutoModCellFile/Joints.html
Joints]] for further information.

@constructor Construct a new rotational joint from the data stream.

@param scene Reference to the CellScene of which this joint is a part.

@param flags Cell flags dictating how the joint data is formatted.

@throws [[org.facsim.anim.cell.IncorrectFormatException!]] if the file supplied
is not an ''AutoMod® cell'' file.

@throws [[org.facsim.anim.cell.ParsingErrorException!]] if errors are
encountered during parsing of the file.

@see [[http://facsim.org/Documentation/Resources/AutoModCellFile/Joints.html
