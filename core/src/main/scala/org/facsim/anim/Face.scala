/**
Class representing a 3D face.

A single face is constructed from a list of three or more vertices, which
should be coplanar; faces with more than three vertices are rendered as (''n''
- 2) ''triangular'' faces (faces represented by just three vertices), where
''n'' is the number of vertices.

Each triangular face takes the first vertex in the list and a pair of
consecutive vertices. For example, if a list of 5 vertices are provided,
labeled as ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' and ''E'', then this face will be
rendered as three faces formed from these vertices as follows:
  - ''A'', ''B'', ''C''
  - ''A'', ''C'', ''D''
  - ''A'', ''D'', ''E''

These sets of triangular face vertices should be non-self-intersecting.

The face normal (the direction in which the face is visible), faces towards the
viewer when the listed vertices appear in counterclockwise order; if the
vertices appear in clockwise order, then the face is invisible. (This behavior
can be modified by selecting a different ScalaFX cull face option when
rendering each face.) All triangular faces making up this face should be
coplanar and should share the same face normal.

@constructor Construct an explicit texture-mapped face from a list of ''rich''
points.

@param vertices List of coplanar points defining the vertices of the face. At
least three vertices are required, with an additional contiguous face being
defined for each additional vertex. Each vertex includes a point in 3D
animation space as well as associated texture map coordinate.

@param smoothingGroup Smoothing group array for this face. If 0, then the face
belongs to no smoothing groups; otherwise, the face belongs to the smoothing
group corresponding to each bit set.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if `vertices` is `null`.

@throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if `vertices` has fewer than 3
points defined.
