/**
Texture map point.

A texture map is a rectangular image that is mapped onto one or more 3D faces,
giving them the texture of the image.

Texture points identify a location on the image that corresponds to the vertex
of a 3D face.

@constructor Create new texture map point.

@param u Horizontal texture map coordinate. This value must be in the range [0,
1], with 0 representing the extreme left edge of the texture map, and 1 the
extreme right edge. Horizontal texture map coordinates are conventionally
denoted by ''u''.

@param v Vertical texture map coordinate. This value must be in the range [0,
1], with 0 representing the extreme top edge of the texture map, and 1 the
extreme bottom edge. Vertical texture map coordinates are conventionally
denoted by ''v''.

@throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if either `u` or `v` is outside of
the range [0, 1].
