Maintains summary statistics for a set of observations.

Statistics reported are:
 -  Number of observations recorded.
 -  Minimum observation.
 -  Maximum observation.
 -  Mean observation.
 -  Sample variance.
 -  Sample standard deviation.

@todo Population variance and population standard deviation are currently
unsupported.

This is a stateful object, whose contents change with each new observation.

@todo Consider making this an immutable object, in which each new observation
results in a new summary statistic instance.  That could prove to be expensive,
but would be more functional.
