''Work-in-progress'' - also known as ''work-in-process'' - (WIP) statistic.

Statistic that tracks the number of jobs in a system, process, buffer, etc.
As well as the current levels, the statistic tracks maximum, mean and minimum
levels.

The mean value is time-weighted, meaning that it weights the mean by the time
spent at each WIP level.

@constructor Create new WIP-tracking statistic.

@param initial Initial work-in-progress.  This value must be zero or positive;
an exception is thrown if this value is negative.

@throws java.lang.IllegalArgumentException if '''initial''' is negative.

@since 0.0
