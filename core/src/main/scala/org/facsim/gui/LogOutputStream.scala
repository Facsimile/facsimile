Write a single character into the log window.

@todo This may be a problem if the executing thread is not the ''JavaFX
Application Thread'' (''JAT''). If so, it would be necessary to use the
[[javafx.application.Platform.runLater(Runnable)]] method to append text to the
text area on the JAT. However, it would be very inefficient to schedule every
single character to be written in this way. Instead, each line of output would
need to be buffered and only written to the text area when a line termination
sequence is encountered.

@param c Character to be written.
