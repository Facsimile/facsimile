''Akka actor'' for ''JavaFX'' user interfaces.

Code executed by this actor will run on the ''JavaFX event-dispatch thread''.

@note Although not recommended, it is possible to have multiple ''JavaFX'' actors in the same application. However, all
such actors will run on the same ''JavaFX event-dispatch thread'', since this is a requirement of ''JavaFX''.

@param stage Primary stage for this actor.
