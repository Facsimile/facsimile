/**
EventId object.

@note This object could have been called "Event" and could have been a
companion object to the [[org.facsim.engine.Event]] class. However, classes and
their companion objects can access each other's private members - meaning that
it would be possible for the [[org.facsim.engine.Event]] class to access the
[[org.facsim.engine.EventId.id]] member directly, by-passing the synchronized
access provided by the [[org.facsim.engine.EventId.nextId]] method. By,
instead, choosing to make it a separate, package-private object, we restrict
the visibility of the object generally, while also ensuring that the
[[org.facsim.engine.EventId.id]] member is solely access through the
[[org.facsim.engine.EventId.nextId]] method. Furthermore, it's possible that we
may not even need this object in future ''Facsimile'' releases, so hiding it as
much as possible makes even more sense.
