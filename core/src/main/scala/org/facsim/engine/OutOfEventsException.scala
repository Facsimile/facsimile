/**
Thrown when the simulation runs of out events.

In general, this should be regarded as abnormal termination of a simulation
run and treated accordingly.

A ''non-terminating'' simulation should never run out of events.

A ''terminating'' simulation is anticipated to ultimately run out of events;
however, since ''(a)'' a terminating simulation might run out of events
prematurely, due to a bug, and ''(b)'' terminating simulations may have
background events (such as scheduled operator breaks, etc.) that continue to
occur event after the simulation has effectively terminated. it is preferable
that terminating simulations detect that termination criteria have been met
resulting in a controlled termination of the simulation run.
