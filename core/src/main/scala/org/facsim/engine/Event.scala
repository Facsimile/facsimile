/**
Class representing all $facsimile simulation events.

Events are constructed and scheduled for dispatch via the
[[org.facsim.facsimile.engine.Simulation.schedule schedule]] function; events
cannot be constructed by user code.

When an event is dispatched, its associated actions are executed, changing the
state of the simulation.

@constructor Create event by associated it with a set of actions that are to be
dispatched after the specified delay, with the specified priority.

@param action Action to be executed when this event is dispatched.

@param delay Delay, measured relative to the current time, after which the
event should be dispatched.  Events will be dispatched in order of their due
time.

@param priority Event's relative priority.  The higher this value, the higher
the priority of the event.  If two events are scheduled for dispatch at the
same due time, the event with the higher priority value be dispatched first.
If two events are scheduled for dispatch at the same due time, with the same
priority, then the events will be dispatched in the order in which they were
scheduled.
