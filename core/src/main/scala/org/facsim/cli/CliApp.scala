''Command line interface'' (''CLI'') application trait.

Applications implementing this trait will execute from the command line and
will not feature a ''graphical user interface'' (''GUI''). All output will be
in the form of text written to the system's standard output and standard error
output. Consequently, such applications are suitable for execution as batch
jobs on a server.
