/**
Class representing a measurements from a specific, but generalized, physical
quantity family.

The role of this class is to allow general multiplication and division of pairs
of measurement values.

For example, when a length measurement is divided by a time measurement the
result is a velocity measurement.  However creating tables that define the
result of each pair of divisors would be time-consuming, error prone and
non-exhaustive.

A simpler approach is to create a generic measurement capturing the family's
characteristics that can be converted, if required, to the corresponding
specific physical measurement for that family by implicit conversion.  If the
generic measurement's family is not identical to the specific measurement it is
being converted to, an exception will result.  For example, we could obtain a
generic measurement that has velocity characteristics by dividing a length by a
time.  If we then attempt to convert this generic value to a velocity, it will
succeed; however, if we attempt to convert it to a temperature, an exception
will result.
