/**
A reader for text data streams.

This class simplifies the parsing of text streams by reading the next field
(delimited as specified) from the stream and returning it as the required data
type after optional verification.

Furthermore, this reader harmonizes line termination sequences, so that all
lines appear to terminate with a ''line feed'' character
('\n')&mdash;regardless of the actual line termination sequence.  (Typically,
''Windows'', ''DOS'' and ''OS/2'' text streams terminate lines with a
''carriage return'' character followed by a ''line feed'' character ('\r\n');
''Unix'' and ''Unix''-like systems, such as ''Linux'', ''Mac OS'' (versions X
and higher) and the ''BSD'' variants, terminate with a single ''line feed''
character ('\n'); older Mac OS systems (9 and earlier) terminate with a single
''carriage return'' character ('\r').  This reader, and its subclasses, allow
all text streams to be treated as though they come from a ''Unix''-like system.

@todo Implement support for comments (ignore remainder of line, whole of line).

@todo Implement support for quoted fields (such as those in CSV files).

@todo Implement support for named fields (to assist with error reporting).

@constructor Constructs a new reader from a data stream reader.

@param textReader Reader from which data is to be read.

@param defaultDelimiter Default set of characters and associated rules for
delimiting fields, if an appropriate delimiter is not explicitly or implicitly
specified for a field read operation. If omitted, this argument defaults to the
WhitespaceDelimiter.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if reader is null.

@param peekedChar Last peeked character read from the reader.  If no character
has been peeked, the value is `None`.

numbering begins at 1 and is incremented each time a line termination sequence
is read.  Line numbering is not to be updated until a line termination sequence
has been read (rather than being peeked).

@param column Column from which the next character will be read.  Ideally,
column numbering counts whole Unicode characters, not simply bytes or partial
characters (as can be the case in ''UTF-8'' and ''UTF-16'' formats).  By
convention, column numbering beings at 1 and is incremented each time a
character is read.  The column number must be reset to 1 each time a line
termination sequence has been read&mdash;the same point at which the line
number is incremented.  Column numbering is not to be updated until a character
has been read (rather than being peeked).
