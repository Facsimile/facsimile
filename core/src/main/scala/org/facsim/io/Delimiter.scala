/**
Field delimiters to be used with [[org.facsim.io.TextReader!]]-based readers.

Delimiters are sets of one or more characters that delimit fields in a text
data stream.

In some data formats, a single delimiter character from the set is used to
delimit fields.  Examples include ''comma-separated value'' (''CSV'') files
that use comma (',') and ''line feed'' ('\n') characters as delimiters, and
tab-delimited files that use ''horizontal tab'' ('\t') and ''line feed'' ('\n')
characters as delimiters.  Consecutive delimiters denote empty fields and are
not merged.  Such delimiters must be constructed with the
'''mergeConsecutive''' argument set to `false`.

In other data formats, consecutive delimiters are merged together and treated
as a single delimiter.  Examples include whitespace-delimited text files that
use ''space'' (' '), ''horizontal tab'' ('\t') and ''line feed'' ('\n')
characters as delimiters.  Such delimiters must set '''mergeConsecutive''' to
`true`.

@constructor Construct a new delimiter instance.

@param delimiters Set of characters to be treated as delimiters.  Note that the
''line feed'' ('\n') character is not automatically added to the set and must
be explicitly included if required.  Note also that the ''line feed'' character
matches all line termination sequences$mdash;refer to
[[org.facsim.io.TextReader!]] for further information.  The ''null'' ('\0') and
''carriage return'' ('\r') characters cannot be used as delimiters and will
result in an exception being thrown if included in the delimiter set.  If the
set of delimiters is empty, then an associated reader will return the entire
file as a single field.

@param mergeConsecutive If `true`, consecutive delimiter characters will be
treated as a single delimiter.  If `false`, consecutive delimiter characters
will be treated as separate delimiters, and will consequently delimit empty
fields.

@throws java.lang.NullPointerException if '''delimiters''' is `null`.

@throws java.lang.InvalidArgumentException if '''delimiters''' contains invalid
delimiter characters.

@see [[org.facsim.io.TextReader!]] for further information.
