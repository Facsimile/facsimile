# Resource bundle properties file (en_US locale) for the Facsimile library.
#
# NOTE: This file is ISO-8859-1 encoded NOT UTF-8 encoded. When inserting
# special characters, they MUST be entered as the equivalent Unicode escape
# sequence (of the form \uHHHH, where "HHHH" is four hexadecimal characters).
#
# For the syntax of this file, refer to:
#
#   http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/text/MessageFormat.html
#
# Each section in this file must correspond to a Java/Scala package. Each
# section must be named for the corresponding package name, after the prefix
# "org.facsim." has been removed. For example, the package "org.facsim.x" will
# be named "x". (The root package is regarded as having an empty name.)
#
# Sections must be listed in alphabetical, hierarchical order. For example:
#
#   {empty}
#   a
#   a.a
#   a.b
#   a.b.a
#   b
#
# Resource keys must be named as follows:
#
# sectionName.elementName[.propertyName]
#
# where "sectionName" is the section name and "elementName" is the name of
# class, object, trait or function to which the resource key belongs.
#
# If the associated element's name ends in "Exception", then that suffix should
# be removed from the corresponding resource key name. For example, if
# exception class org.facsim.somepackage.SomeException requires an error
# message resource key, then that key would likely be called
# "somepackage.Some".
#
# Elements that require, or that potentially require, multiple resource keys
# must append a unique propertyName identifier (see above) to each resource key
# name.
#
# Within each section, resource keys must be listed in alphabetical,
# hierarchical order. For example, resource keys in package "x" would be listed
# as follows:
#
#   x.ClassA
#   x.ClassB.propertyA
#   x.ClassB.propertyB
#   x.ClassC
#
# Alphabetical, hierarchical ordering of sections and resource keys assists
# with maintenance and organization - particularly for large resource files.
