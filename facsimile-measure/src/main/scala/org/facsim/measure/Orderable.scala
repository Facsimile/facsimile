/** Abstract base class for objects that can be compared for equality, and sorted in order.
 *
 *  Implementing objects can be ordered as well as compared for equality and inequality.
 *
 *  @note At present, this must be an ''abstract class'', rather than a ''trait'', because the latter do not currently
 *  support class bounds (such as [[ClassTag]]). Implementing types must ensure that [[compare()]] returns 0 for classes
 *  that are equivalent, and non-zero for classes that are not equivalent. Furthermore, [[hashCode]] values for
 *  equivalent objects must be identical too.
 *
 *  @tparam T Type of object implementing ordering operations, which must implement this base class.
 *
 *  @since 0.0
