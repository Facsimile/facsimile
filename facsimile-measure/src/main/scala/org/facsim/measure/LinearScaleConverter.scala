/**
 * Linear scale converter.
 *
 * Converts physical quantity measurement units of an associated, but unspecified, unit to and from the corresponding
 * standard ''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI SI]]'' units for the unit family. Values are ''imported'' (converted to
 * ''SI'' unit values) by multiplying by the specified linear scaling factor and are ''exported'' (converted from ''SI''
 * unit values) by dividing by the same factor.
 *
 * @constructor Create new linear scale converter from the specified linear scaling '''factor'''.
 *
 * @param factor Linear scaling factor to be employed. This value must be finite and cannot be zero or one. A value of
 * zero causes divide-by-zero exceptions when exporting values and implies that the magnitude of all measurement values
 * is 0. A value of one implies that the units are already ''SI'' units, since no scaling is performed, in which case
 * the [[org.facsim.measure.SIConverter]] object should be preferred.
 *
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if '''factor''' is NaN, infinite, zero or one.
