/**
 * Class representing a measurement from any physical quantity family.
 *
 * The role of this class is to allow general multiplication and division of pairs of measurements from different
 * physical quantity families, such that the result belongs to a different family to either of the operands.
 *
 * For example, when a [[org.facsim.measure.Length]] measurement is divided by a [[org.facsim.measure.Time]]
 * measurement, the result is a [[org.facsim.measure.Velocity]] measurement. However creating tables that define the
 * result of each pair of operands for each operation would be time-consuming, error prone and non-exhaustive.
 *
 * A simpler approach is to create a generic measurement, capturing the family's characteristics, which can be converted
 * to the corresponding specific physical measurement for that family by implicit conversion. If the generic
 * measurement's family is not identical to the specific measurement it is being converted to, an exception will result.
 *
 * For example, we could obtain a generic measurement that has ''velocity'' characteristics by dividing a ''length'' by
 * a ''time''. If we then attempt to convert this generic value to a ''velocity'', it will succeed; however, if we
 * attempt to convert it to a ''temperature'', an exception will result.
