/**
 * ''[[http://facsim.org/ Facsimile]]'' physical quantity measurement elements.
 *
 * The `org.facsim.measure` package contains elements for expressing measurements of a variety of ''physical
 * quantities'', such as ''time'', ''mass'', ''length'', ''angle'', ''thermodynamic temperature'', etc., in whatever
 * units the user believes to be the most appropriate.
 *
 * =Physical Quantity Unit Families=
 *
 * For each physical quantity, there are typically a set of units in which measurements of that physical quantity can be
 * expressed. For instance, ''time'' can be measured in ''seconds'', ''minutes'', or ''hours'', etc. In ''Facsimile'',
 * such a set of units is termed a ''unit family''.
 *
 * Each unit family is encapsulated as a subclass of the `[[org.facsim.measure.Physical]]` abstract base class. For
 * example, time units are encapsulated by the `[[org.facsim.measure.Time.TimeUnits]] Unit` subclass, mass units by the
 * `[[org.facsim.measure.Mass.MassUnits]] Unit` subclass, length units by the
 * `[[org.facsim.measure.Length.LengthUnits]] Unit` subclass, etc.
 *
 * =Physical Quantity Units=
 *
 * ''Facsimile'' allows users to work with whichever units make the most sense for a particular application, while
 * interoperating seamlessly with code written using different units; conversion of values between different units in
 * the same family takes place automatically, eliminating a whole class of conversion errors.
 *
 * Individual physical quantity units are represented by instances of the corresponding unit family class. For example,
 * ''seconds'', ''minutes'' and ''hours'' are represented by instances of the `[[org.facsim.measure.Time.TimeUnits]]`
 * class.
 *
 * =Physical Quantity Measurements=
 *
 * @todo Expand on Facsimile's use of units. Facsimile allows users to use one or more measurement units, as they see
 * fit, rather than being forced to adopt a single unit of measure (say seconds for time, inches for length, etc.).
 * Since all measurements are stored internally in SI units, no matter which units are employed by the user, there are
 * never conversion issues when merging models that use different units.
 *
 * @todo Expand on Facsimile's use of types for each measurement quantity. Instead of using a `[[scala.Double]]`, like
 * other simulation systems, Facsimile uses different types for each measurement quantity. Consequently, it's not
 * possible to confuse a distance with a time, or a linear velocity with an angular velocity, or a mass with a
 * temperature. By employing an appropriate set of operators, mechanics formulae can be accommodated by Facsimile in a
 * very natural way. By ensuring data ranges are valid (no negative times or masses), Facsimile ensures data integrity
 * throughout all runs.
