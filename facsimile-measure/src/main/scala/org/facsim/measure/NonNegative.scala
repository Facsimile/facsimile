 * Developer notes:
 *
 * This is an abstract class, rather than a trait, to prevent it from being used as a base class. The rationale is that
 * the implementation of this class, from the viewpoint of a subclass, might change dramatically during Facsimile's
 * existence. Since there are no user-serviceable parts inside, it has been deemed that the best approach is simply to
 * keep a tight lid on things.
