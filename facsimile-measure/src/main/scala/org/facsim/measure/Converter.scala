/**
 * Physical quantity unit converter trait.
 *
 * Converter subclasses support the conversion of physical quantity measurement values between different units belonging
 * to the same family.
 *
 * More specifically, each converter instance has the capability to convert a physical quantity measurement value from a
 * specific unit of measure to the standard ''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI SI]]'' units for the associated unit
 * family.
 *
 * For example, a converter instance would be used to convert ''time''s expressed in ''hours'' to or from times
 * expressed in ''seconds''&mdash;the standard ''SI'' unit of time measurement.
 *
 * The process of converting a value to ''SI'' units is termed ''importing''; the process of converting an ''SI'' value
 * to the associated unit is termed ''exporting''.
 *
 * @see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI International System of Units]] on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]].
