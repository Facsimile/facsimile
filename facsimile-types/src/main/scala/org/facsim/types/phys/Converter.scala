/** Physical quantity unit converter trait.
 *
 *  Converter subclasses support the conversion of physical quantity measurement values between different units
 *  belonging to the same family.
 *
 *  More specifically, each converter instance has the capability to convert a physical quantity measurement value from
 *  a specific unit of types to the standard _[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI SI]]_ units for the associated unit
 *  family.
 *
 *  For example, a converter instance would be used to convert _time_s expressed in _hours_ to or from times
 *  expressed in _seconds_&mdash;the standard _SI_ unit of time measurement.
 *
 *  The process of converting a value to _SI_ units is termed _importing_; the process of converting an _SI_ value
 *  to the associated unit is termed _exporting_.
 *
 *  @see [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI International System of Units]] on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/ Wikipedia]].
