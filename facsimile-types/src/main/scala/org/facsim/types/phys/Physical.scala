   *  Each concrete subclass represents a single ''physical quantity unit family''. For example, time units are
   *  represented by the `[[org.facsim.types.phys.Time.TimeUnits TimeUnits]]` subclass of `PhysicalUnits`.
   *
   *  Each unit family supports one or more ''units of types''. For example, time quantities may be measured in
   *  ''seconds'', ''minutes'', ''hours'', etc. These units are represented by instances of the concrete `PhysicalUnits`
   *  subclass. For each unit family, there is a standard unit of types defined by the
   *  ''[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI International System of Units]]''&mdash;commonly abbreviated to ''SI Units''.
   *
   *  These standard units are used by ''Facsimile'' internally to store measurement quantities (as immutable instances
   *  of `[[org.facsim.types.phys.Physical.PhysicalMeasure PhysicalMeasure]]` subclasses, with each subclass
   *  corresponding to each measurement type.) For example, the ''SI'' standard unit of types for ''time'' is the
   *  ''second''; consequently, ''Facsimile'' stores and calculates all time quantities, internally, in ''seconds''.
   *  Adoption of the ''SI'' standard units simplifies the implementation of physics calculations within ''Facsimile''
   *  and provides a clearly-defined basis for developing simulation models of the real-world. (Many other simulation
   *  modeling tools suffer from ''unit of types confusion'', both internally and externally, creating a wide variety of
   *  problems.)
   *
   *  However, it is unreasonable to expect that ''Facsimile'' users would be comfortable entering and reviewing data
   *  solely in these units. For instance, the ''SI'' standard unit of types for ''angles'' is the
   *  ''radian''&mdash;and there are few people who don't find the ''degree'' a far more intuitive alternative.
   *  Similarly, users in the United States&mdash;or their customers&mdash;might prefer ''feet'' & ''inches'',
   *  ''pounds'', ''Fahrenheit'', etc. to their metric equivalents. Consequently, ''Facsimile'' allows users to work
   *  with whichever units they prefer. ''Facsimile'' converts values to the standard ''SI'' units on input and converts
   *  them to the required units on output.
