/** Marker trait for operators exhibiting the _[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_property associative]]_
 *  property.
 *
 *  Instances of this trait support ''associative'' operations. That is, given some operation `op`, `op(a, op(b, c))`
 *  must equal `op(op(a, b), c)` for all `a`, `b` and `c`.
 *
 *  @note This trait is primarily used for _testing_ that subclass operator implementations are indeed associative; it
 *  typically plays no role in the implementation itself.
 *
 *  @tparam A Type of one argument to the associative operation.
 *
 *  @tparam B Type of another argument to the associative operation.
 *
 *  @tparam C Type of final argument to the associative operation.
 *
 *  @tparam R Type of the result of the associative operation.
 *
 *  @since 0.0
