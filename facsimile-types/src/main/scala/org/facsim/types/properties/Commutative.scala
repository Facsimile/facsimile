/** Marker trait for operators exhibiting the _[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commutative_property commutative]]_
 *  property.
 *
 *  Instances of this trait support _commutative_ operations. That is, given some operation `op`, `op(a, b)` must
 *  equal `op(b, a)` for all `a` and `b`.
 *
 *  @note This trait is primarily used for _testing_ that subclass operator implementations are indeed commutative; it
 *  typically plays no role in the implementation itself.
 *
 *  @tparam A Type of one argument to the commutative operation.
 *
 *  @tparam B Type of the other argument to the commutative operation.
 *
 *  @tparam R Type of the result of the commutative operation.
 *
 *  @since 0.0
