# git .gitattributes file.

# Determine how git will treat line endings in files belonging to Facsimile.
# It will override any defined 'core.autocrlf' git configuration.
#==============================================================================

# Set default behaviour text behavior.  This is equivalent to the git config
# 'core.autocrlf' flag.

* text=auto

# Typically, all text files (Scala sources, Maven POM files, XML files, Eclipse
# preference/configuration/project files, etc.) should be normalized and
# converted to native line endings on checkout.
#
# TODO: For now, we're specifying that platform-specific scripts (such as
# Windows batch and command scripts, bash shell scripts) should be treated as
# all other source files, even if they should have platform-specific line
# endings in platform-specific distributions.
#
# Note: Some file types (.dxf, .wrl, and others) have binary as well as text
# formats.  We should only ever use text versions of these files.
