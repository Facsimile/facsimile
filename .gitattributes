# Determine how git will treat line endings in files belonging to Facsimile. It will override any defined
# 'core.autocrlf' git configuration.

# Set default behaviour text behavior. This is equivalent to the git config 'core.autocrlf' flag.

* text=auto

# Typically, all text files (Scala sources, Maven POM files, XML files, Eclipse preference/configuration/project files,
# etc.) should be normalized and converted to native line endings on checkout.
#
# TODO: For now, we're specifying that platform-specific scripts (such as Windows batch and command scripts, bash shell
# scripts) should be treated as all other source files, even if they should have platform-specific line endings in
# platform-specific distributions.
#
# Note: Some file types (.dxf, .wrl, and others) have binary as well as text formats. We should only ever use text
# versions of these files.
