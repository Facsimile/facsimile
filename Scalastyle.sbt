// Configure Scalastyle configuration file location.
//
// IntelliJ IDEA looks for the Scalastyle configuration file (whicb, at the time of writing, must be called
// "scalastyle_config.xml") in either the /.idea or the /project directories, rather than the project root directory,
// which is the Scalastyle default location. To keep both systems happy, this file is placed in the /project directory,
// and so Scalastyle must be configured to look there for this file.
