Facsimile Simulation Library
============================

The _Facsimile_ project's goal is to develop and maintain a high-quality, 3D,
discrete-event simulation library that can be used for industrial simulation
projects in an engineering and/or manufacturing environment.

Facsimile simulations run on the _Java Virtual Machine_ under _Microsoft
Windows_, _Linux_, _Mac OS X_, _BSD_ and _Unix_.
