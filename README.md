Facsimile Simulation Library
============================

The _Facsimile_ project's goal is to develop and maintain a high-quality, 3D,
discrete-event simulation library that can be used for industrial simulation
projects in an engineering and/or manufacturing environment.

Facsimile simulations run on the _Java Virtual Machine_ under _Microsoft
Windows_, _Linux_, _Mac OS X_, _BSD_ and _Unix_.

Facsimile is open-source/free software and is distributed under version 3 of
the _[GNU General Public License]
(http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0-standalone.html GNU General Public)_
(GPLv3).

Instructions for working with _Facsimile_, and for working on _Facsimile_
development, are to follow shortly...
