Facsimile Simulation Library
============================

The _Facsimile_ project's goal is to develop and maintain a high-quality, 3D, discrete-event simulation library that can
be used for industrial simulation projects in an engineering and/or manufacturing environment.

Facsimile simulations run on the _Java Virtual Machine_ under _Microsoft Windows_, _Linux_, _Mac OS X_, _BSD_ and
_Unix_.
